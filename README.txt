Exercise 2
Alon Levy and Elad maman 

Design inspiration: 
Our design inspiration was taken from a few things: 
1. The color - We wanted it to look like a kind of nuclear energy, with some red, purple, and yellow colors.
2. The moving band - We wanted to have a repetitive pattern that moves across the field, giving it a sort of a "loading" vibe...
3. The Wave - The inspiration for the wave that moves over the shield came from the look from the star wars movies : 
The look of how some force shields look like when something hits tham. 
4 The glow - since our shield is mostly transparent, we wanted a way to give a presentation to the shield at all times.

Design Steps: 
1. The color - mix of some colors that we think that lock nuclear and added some an online texture with some movement to make it lock alive like energy.
2. The moving band - We started with moving the band using sin and cos... Waste of time. We've found an easier way to do it using the step node
3. The Wave - with some help from our beloved teacher we successfully made a function that with time makes the forcefield vertexes move like a circle wave that moves from the bottom to the top.
4 The glow - We've connected a fractioned time node to a Fresnel effect node and connected that to the alpha as well as the colors of the field
 

What would we improve given more time?
1. Change the shape of the moving wave to a more complex shape.
2. Create a different and unique pattern for the colors.
